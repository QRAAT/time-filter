For various PULSE_ERROR functions, compute the variance on the resulting 
positions. Before computing the variance, we do iterative outlier eliminationg
to eliminate the skewing affect of biased (unbounded) position estimates, that 
is, maximum likelihood positions over unbounded search spaces resulting from 
missing data from a particular site. These data pertain to deploymentID=105 on 
7/8/14.
