Time filter experiments. 

take1/ - 

Modeling pulse error as a function of variation in the pulse interval. An 
analysis of one day's worth of data from a fixed transmitter. Since the data
rate (data_rate.png) is not representative of variations higher than 1.0, the 
results here are inconclusive. See take3/ for plans for continued work in this 
direction. 

  Results:

    SCORE_INTERVAL = 3 minutes
    SCORE_NEIGHBORHOOD = 20 seconds
    SCORE_ERROR = lambda(x) : (-0.6324 / (x + 7.7640)) + 0.1255 seconds
    SCORE_THRESHOLD = 0.20 (lower bound on relative score for pos. est.)

Qualitatively evaluate the results of take1/. Does the time filter yield 
performance gains over the band filter alone?
